# Owner's notes ledger

Every note the owner has given, his words, one line. `check` = the audit line that proves it. `status`: built / open / dropped by him.
A note without a check, or with a failing check, fails the audit. Repeated notes are marked `xN`.

|---|---|---|---|
| 09-02 | there's stairs, windows and doors which need a clean up | file: stairs, openings | built |
| 09-02 | browser, GitHub for data and site, public repo, name KOAN.hang, keep the courtyard | app | built |

| 09-02 | make sure all measurements are exact; stairs don't point up over the floor | mesh: stairs | built |
